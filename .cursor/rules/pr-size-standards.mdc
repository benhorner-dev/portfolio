# Pull Request Size Guidelines

## Size Limits
- **Ideal**: 200-400 lines of changes
- **Maximum**: 800 lines of changes
- **Red flag**: 1000+ lines requires justification

## Rule: If your PR looks too big, sub-task your Linear ticket

## When to Split PRs
- **Multiple features** - each feature should be its own PR
- **Refactoring + new features** - separate refactoring from feature work
- **Database migrations + code changes** - split schema changes from application logic
- **Multiple components/modules** - break down by logical boundaries

## How to Sub-task in Linear
1. **Break down the original ticket** into smaller, focused tasks
2. **Each sub-task should be independently deployable** when possible
3. **Create clear dependencies** between sub-tasks in Linear
4. **Use descriptive sub-task titles** that explain the specific change
5. **Link related sub-tasks** in PR descriptions

## Benefits of Smaller PRs
- **Faster review cycles** - easier for reviewers to understand
- **Reduced merge conflicts** - less time between creation and merge
- **Easier rollbacks** - granular changes are easier to revert
- **Better testing** - focused changes are easier to test thoroughly
- **Improved code quality** - reviewers can focus on details

## Exceptions
- **Auto-generated code** (migrations, API clients)
- **Large data files** or configuration updates
- **Dependency updates** with extensive lock file changes
- **Critical hotfixes** (but still prefer smaller changes when possible)
