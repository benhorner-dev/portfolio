# 2. Multi-Provider AI Architecture with LangGraph

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires a sophisticated AI system capable of:

- Intelligent conversation and chat capabilities
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge-based responses
- Vector similarity search for relevant content
- Graph-based relationship mapping for complex queries
- Multiple LLM providers for redundancy and cost optimization
- Agent orchestration for complex workflows

The system needs to handle various AI workloads including:

- User queries about portfolio content
- Course recommendations and learning paths
- Technical explanations and code analysis
- Real-time conversation with context awareness

## Decision

Implement a multi-provider AI architecture using:

- **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Multiple LLM providers** (OpenAI, Cohere) for redundancy and specialized capabilities
- **Pinecone** for vector database and similarity search
- **Neo4j** for graph database and relationship mapping
- **RAG implementation** with vector search and retrieval
- **Agent factory pattern** for flexible tool and LLM configuration

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Resilience**: Multiple LLM providers prevent single points of failure
- **Cost optimization**: Can choose providers based on cost and performance
- **Specialized capabilities**: Different providers excel at different tasks
- **Scalability**: Vector and graph databases handle large-scale data efficiently
- **Flexibility**: Agent factory allows easy addition of new tools and providers

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple providers and databases increases system complexity
- **Cost**: Multiple services increase operational costs
- **Integration overhead**: More APIs and services to maintain and monitor
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring consistency across multiple data stores
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand multiple AI technologies

### Risks

- **Provider lock-in**: Dependency on external AI services
- **API rate limits**: Multiple providers may have different rate limiting
- **Cost escalation**: Usage-based pricing can lead to unexpected costs
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive data processed by external AI services
