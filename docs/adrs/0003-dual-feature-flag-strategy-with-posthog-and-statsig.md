# 3. Dual Feature Flag Strategy with PostHog and Statsig

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires comprehensive feature flag management for:

- Client-side feature toggles with analytics integration
- Server-side feature gates with user identification
- A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- Real-time feature flag updates
- Integration with Vercel deployment pipeline
- User segmentation and targeting

The system needs to handle:

- Different flag types (boolean, string, number)
- User identification and targeting
- Analytics and event tracking
- Performance optimization
- Developer experience and ease of use

## Decision

Implement a dual feature flag strategy using:

- **PostHog** for client-side feature flags with analytics integration
- **Statsig** for server-side feature gates with user identification
- **Unified flag interface** with different adapters
- **Auto-discovery endpoint** for Vercel integration
- **Type-safe flag definitions** with TypeScript

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Separation of concerns**: Client and server flags are managed independently
- **Analytics integration**: PostHog provides built-in analytics for client flags
- **User targeting**: Statsig enables sophisticated user segmentation
- **Performance**: Each provider optimized for their use case
- **Flexibility**: Can choose the right tool for each flag type

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Managing two different feature flag systems
- **Cost**: Two separate service subscriptions
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand both platforms
- **Consistency**: Ensuring flag behavior is consistent across providers
- **Debugging**: More complex troubleshooting with multiple systems

### Risks

- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on two external services
- **Cost escalation**: Usage-based pricing on both platforms
- **Data synchronization**: Keeping user data consistent between providers
- **API changes**: Both providers may change their APIs independently
