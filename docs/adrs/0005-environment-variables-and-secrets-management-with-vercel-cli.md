# 5. Environment Variables and Secrets Management with Vercel CLI

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires secure and efficient management of environment variables and secrets across:

- Multiple environments (development, preview, production)
- Different team members and deployment contexts
- Sensitive data like API keys, database URLs, and authentication secrets
- CI/CD pipelines and automated deployments
- Local development and testing

The system needs to handle:

- Secure storage and access to secrets
- Environment-specific configuration
- Easy synchronization between local and remote environments
- Team collaboration without exposing secrets
- Automated deployment configuration

## Decision

Implement environment variables and secrets management using Vercel CLI:

- **Vercel environment variables** for secure secret storage
- **Vercel CLI** for local environment synchronization
- **Environment-specific configurations** (development, preview, production)
- **Automatic secret injection** during deployment
- **Local .env files** for development (gitignored)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Security**: Secrets stored securely in Vercel's encrypted storage
- **Team collaboration**: Easy sharing of environment configuration
- **Environment consistency**: Same variables across all environments
- **Automated deployment**: Secrets automatically injected during builds
- **Easy management**: Simple CLI commands for environment management

### Negative

- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on Vercel for secret management
- **CLI dependency**: Team needs to install and use Vercel CLI
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand Vercel's environment system
- **Cost**: Vercel may have limits on environment variables
- **Debugging**: Environment issues may be harder to debug

### Risks

- **Secret exposure**: Risk of accidentally exposing secrets in logs or code
- **Access control**: Need to manage who has access to which secrets
- **Backup**: No easy way to backup environment configuration
- **Migration**: Difficult to migrate to other platforms
- **CLI failures**: Vercel CLI issues could block development
