# 4. Multi-Database Architecture with Specialized Databases

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires different types of data storage and retrieval:

- **Relational data**: User profiles, authentication, application state
- **Vector data**: AI embeddings for similarity search and RAG
- **Graph data**: Complex relationships between concepts, courses, and content
- **Caching**: Session data, API responses, and temporary data
- **Key-value storage**: Feature flags, configuration, and simple data

The system needs to handle:

- High-performance queries for different data types
- Scalability for each specific use case
- Cost optimization based on usage patterns
- Data consistency and integrity
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Decision

Implement a multi-database architecture using specialized databases:

- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database with Drizzle ORM
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for AI embeddings and similarity search
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for relationship mapping and complex queries
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Vercel KV**: Serverless key-value storage for configuration

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Optimized performance**: Each database optimized for its specific use case
- **Scalability**: Can scale each database independently based on usage
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for what each database is used for
- **Specialized features**: Access to advanced features of each database type
- **Flexibility**: Can choose the best tool for each data requirement

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple database systems and connections
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring consistency across multiple data stores
- **Operational overhead**: More databases to monitor, backup, and maintain
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand multiple database technologies
- **Integration complexity**: More complex data flow and synchronization

### Risks

- **Data synchronization**: Keeping data consistent across multiple stores
- **Transaction management**: Complex transactions spanning multiple databases
- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on multiple external services
- **Cost escalation**: Multiple database subscriptions and usage costs
- **Backup complexity**: Coordinating backups across multiple systems
