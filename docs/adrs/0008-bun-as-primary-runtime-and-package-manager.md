Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires a fast, modern JavaScript runtime and package manager that can:

- Execute TypeScript and JavaScript efficiently
- Manage dependencies quickly
- Provide built-in bundling capabilities
- Maintain compatibility with Node.js ecosystem
- Support modern JavaScript features

## Decision

Use Bun as the primary runtime and package manager instead of Node.js and npm/yarn.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: 3x faster than Node.js for most operations
- **Built-in TypeScript**: No need for separate TypeScript compilation
- **Fast package management**: Significantly faster than npm/yarn
- **Modern features**: Built-in bundling, testing, and other tools
- **Node.js compatibility**: Can run most Node.js packages

### Negative

- **Ecosystem maturity**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn Bun-specific features
- **Compatibility issues**: Some packages may not work with Bun
- **Debugging**: Different debugging tools and techniques

### Risks

- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on Bun for optimal performance
- **Package compatibility**: Some npm packages may not work
- **Community support**: Smaller community compared to Node.js
