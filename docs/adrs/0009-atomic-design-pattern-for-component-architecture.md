# 6. Atomic Design Pattern for Component Architecture

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires a scalable, maintainable component architecture that:

- Provides clear hierarchy and organization
- Enables reusability and consistency
- Supports team collaboration
- Scales with project growth
- Maintains design system coherence

## Decision

Implement Atomic Design methodology with five levels:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, headings)
- **Molecules**: Simple component groups (forms, cards)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (headers, chat interfaces)
- **Templates**: Page layouts and structure
- **Pages**: Specific instances with real content

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clear hierarchy**: Easy to understand component relationships
- **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused across the application
- **Consistency**: Design system ensures visual consistency
- **Scalability**: Architecture scales with project growth
- **Team collaboration**: Clear structure helps team coordination

### Negative

- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand Atomic Design principles
- **Rigidity**: May be too structured for some use cases
- **Over-engineering**: Risk of over-abstracting simple components
- **Maintenance**: More complex component organization

### Risks

- **Misclassification**: Components may be placed in wrong atomic level
- **Over-abstraction**: Creating unnecessary component hierarchies
- **Team confusion**: Different developers may interpret levels differently
