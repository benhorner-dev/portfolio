# 7. Comprehensive Error Handling and Monitoring Strategy

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio requires robust error handling and monitoring for:

- Production error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- User experience protection
- Rapid incident response
- Debugging and troubleshooting

## Decision

Implement multi-layered error handling with:

- **Sentry** for error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Custom logging** with different implementations (client/server, dev/prod)
- **Global error boundaries** in React components
- **Slack webhook integration** for critical alerts
- **Structured logging** with Pino

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Comprehensive observability**: Full visibility into application health
- **Rapid response**: Quick detection and alerting of issues
- **User protection**: Error boundaries prevent application crashes
- **Debugging**: Rich error context and stack traces
- **Performance insights**: Monitor and optimize application performance

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Multiple monitoring systems to maintain
- **Cost**: Sentry and other monitoring service subscriptions
- **Noise**: Risk of alert fatigue with too many notifications
- **Privacy**: Error data may contain sensitive information

### Risks

- **Vendor dependency**: Reliance on external monitoring services
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive data in error reports
- **Alert fatigue**: Too many alerts may lead to ignoring important ones
- **Cost escalation**: Usage-based pricing for monitoring services
