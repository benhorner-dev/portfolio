# 9. Turbo Monorepo with Vercel Remote Caching

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio is structured as a monorepo with:

- Multiple applications and packages
- Shared dependencies and configurations
- Complex build dependencies between packages
- Need for fast, incremental builds
- Team collaboration requiring shared build artifacts
- CI/CD pipeline optimization

The system needs to handle:

- Fast build times for development and CI/CD
- Shared caching across team members and environments
- Incremental builds based on changes
- Parallel task execution
- Integration with Vercel deployment pipeline

## Decision

Implement Turbo monorepo management with Vercel remote caching:

- **Turbo** for monorepo task orchestration and build system
- **Vercel remote caching** for shared build artifacts across team and CI/CD
- **Incremental builds** that only rebuild what changed
- **Parallel execution** of independent tasks
- **Dependency graph** for intelligent task ordering

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Fast builds**: Incremental builds and caching dramatically reduce build times
- **Team efficiency**: Shared cache benefits entire team
- **CI/CD optimization**: Faster deployments and reduced CI costs
- **Developer experience**: Faster feedback loops during development
- **Scalability**: Build performance scales with team size

### Negative

- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand Turbo concepts and configuration
- **Cache invalidation**: Complex scenarios where cache invalidation is needed
- **Configuration complexity**: Managing task dependencies and environment variables
- **Debugging**: More complex build debugging with caching layers
- **Vendor dependency**: Reliance on Vercel for remote caching

### Risks

- **Cache corruption**: Invalid cache entries can cause build failures
- **Network dependency**: Remote caching requires reliable network connectivity
- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on Vercel for optimal performance
- **Cache size limits**: Vercel may have limits on cache storage
- **Build consistency**: Ensuring builds work consistently across different cache states
