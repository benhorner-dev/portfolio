# 10. Pragmatic Design Pattern Philosophy

Date: 2025-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio development team needs clear guidance on when and how to apply design patterns:

- Avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary complexity
- Maintaining code readability and maintainability
- Balancing theoretical purity with practical needs
- Ensuring patterns solve real problems, not create artificial ones
- Preventing premature abstraction and pattern-for-pattern's-sake

The team faces common challenges:

- When to abstract vs. when to keep code simple
- How to recognize genuine patterns vs. coincidental similarities
- Balancing code consistency with practical solutions
- Avoiding the "golden hammer" problem with patterns

## Decision

Adopt a pragmatic design pattern philosophy with these principles:

- **Pragmatism over dogmatism**: Choose practical solutions over theoretical purity
- **Rule of Three**: Don't abstract until you have three similar implementations
- **Solve real problems**: Use patterns to address actual complexity, not future needs
- **Favor clarity over cleverness**: Write code that's easy to understand
- **Simple solutions first**: Start with the simplest approach that works

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reduced complexity**: Avoid unnecessary abstractions and over-engineering
- **Better readability**: Code is easier to understand and maintain
- **Faster development**: Less time spent on premature optimization
- **Practical solutions**: Focus on solving real problems rather than theoretical ones
- **Team productivity**: Clear guidelines reduce decision paralysis

### Negative

- **Inconsistency**: Different approaches may be used for similar problems initially
- **Refactoring needs**: May need to refactor when patterns become clear
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand when patterns are appropriate
- **Code review complexity**: Requires judgment calls on pattern application
- **Documentation needs**: Need to document when and why patterns are used

### Risks

- **Inconsistent codebase**: Without clear guidelines, code may become inconsistent
- **Technical debt**: Avoiding patterns may lead to code duplication
- **Team disagreements**: Different developers may have different opinions on pattern usage
- **Maintenance overhead**: Inconsistent approaches may increase maintenance burden
